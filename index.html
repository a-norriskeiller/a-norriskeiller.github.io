                    Consequences of Post-Brexit Trade Barriers for Earnings Inequality in the UK</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">We examine the distributional consequences of post-Brexit trade barriers 
                    on wages in the UK. We quantify changes in trade costs across industries, accounting for input–output 
                    links across domestic industries and global value chains. We allow for demand substitution by firms 
                    and consumers, and worker reallocation across industries. We document the impact at the individual 
                    and household level. Blue-collar workers are the most exposed to negative consequences of higher 
                    trade costs, because they are more likely to be employed in industries that face increases in trade 
                    costs, and are less likely to have good alternative employment opportunities available in their local 
                    labour markets. Overall, new trade costs have a regressive impact, with lower-paid workers facing 
                    higher exposure than higher-paid workers once we account for the exposure of other household members.</div>

                    inequality and the labour market in Britain and the US </a>
                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">We study household income inequality in both Great Britain 
                    and the United States and the interplay between labour market earnings and the tax system. 
                    While both Britain and the US have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality 
                    over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in 
                    Britain while it has risen in the US. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the 
                    interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and 
                    welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed 
                    sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the US and 
                    on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain 
                    played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the 
                    relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the US mean this growing group has seen 
                    particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.</div>

                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">Climate change is making natural disasters more frequent, yet little is known 
                    about the capacity of firms to withstand such disasters and adapt to their increased frequency. We examine this issue using a the 
                    latest wave of the World Management Survey (WMS) that includes new questions on firms’ climate change perceptions and adaptation 
                    behavior. Combining this with geocoded data on natural disasters and previous WMS waves, we create a panel spanning 8,000 
                    firms across 33 countries and three decades that shows exposure to disasters decreases growth inputs, outputs and firm survival. 
                    More importantly, firms with structured management practices are more resilient, suffering much smaller drops in jobs and capital. 
                    To understand the mechanisms behind this resilience, we use the new WMS climate questions to show better managed firms have more 
                    accurate perceptions of climate-related risks to their businesses. Such firms are also more likely to have implemented measures to 
                    adapt to climate change both overall and in response to their perceived climate risk. Other aspects of firm organisation, such as 
                    decentralisation, also help protect against disasters, but their adaptation behaviour is not well-targeted. These results show that 
                    improving management is one way to help protect economies from climate change shocks.</div>

                    Subjective Expectations Data</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">Standard methods for estimating production functions in the Olley and Pakes (1996) 
                    tradition require assumptions on input choices. We introduce a new method that exploits (increasingly available) data on a firm’s 
                    expectations of its future output and inputs that allows us to obtain consistent production function parameter estimates while 
                    relaxing these input demand assumptions. In contrast to dynamic panel methods, our proposed estimator can be implemented on very 
                    short panels (including a single cross-section), and Monte Carlo simulations show it outperforms alternative estimators when firms’ 
                    material input choices are subject to optimization error. Implementing a range of production function estimators on UK data, we 
                    find our proposed estimator yields results that are either similar to or more credible than commonly-used alternatives. These 
                    differences are larger in industries where material inputs appear harder to optimize. We show that TFP implied by our proposed 
                    estimator is more strongly associated with future jobs growth than existing methods, suggesting that failing to adequately account 
                    for input endogeneity may underestimate the degree of dynamic reallocation in the economy.</div>

                    Productivity and Wages in the UK Auto Industry</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">When labour market competition is imperfect, positive industry (and firm) 
                    productivity shocks can be passed through to workers in the form of higher wages. We document how the UK auto industry, 
                    following a period of decline, experienced a four-decade-long productivity boom. There was a thirteen-fold increase in real 
                    output per worker between 1980 and 2018, compared to a four-fold increase in manufacturing. Greater foreign ownership, tougher 
                    competition and improved industrial relations all likely played a role. The greater use of intermediate inputs (outsourcing) 
                    and growing capital intensity account for most of this growth, but we estimate that TFP still grew three times as fast in the 
                    auto industry than the rest of manufacturing. Examining whether this productivity increase has been shared with employees, we 
                    find that auto workers experienced far stronger hourly wage growth than workers in the rest of manufacturing. After controlling 
                    for individual fixed effects, the auto wage premium relative to the rest of manufacturing doubled from 8% in the 1980s to 17% 
                    in the 2010s. Interpreted through the lens of a rent sharing model, we estimate that most of the wage increase (63% in the 
                    baseline case) can be accounted for by the auto productivity boom. In contrast, the bargaining power of UK auto workers seems 
                    to have fallen. If worker power had held up at the 1980s level, the wage premium would have been about 38% higher in the 2010s.</div>

                    An Application to Auto Markets</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden" style="font-size: 10pt">When firms sell in multiple markets, estimates of markups from the demand-side will 
                    generally diverge from estimates based on the supply-side (e.g. via production functions). The empirical examination of the 
                    importance of this fact has been hampered by the absence of market-specific cost data. To overcome this, we show production markups 
                    can be expressed as the revenue-weighted average of demand-based markups across markets (and products). This highlights that a divergence 
                    in demand-based and production-based markups is due to the revenue shares and markups across foreign and domestic markets, factors that 
                    can be assessed with readily available trade data. Using data from auto firms producing in the UK, we show production-based markups 
                    increased between 1998 and 2018 whereas demand-based markups decreased. These trends can be reconciled by an increase in the markup 
                    that UK-based producers gained on their exports, which we corroborate using administrative trade data. We find that increases in 
                    production-based markups have been driven by exports, particularly to China where foreign brands command high markups.</div>

                        investment ground to a halt. This paper uses administrative trade data to investigate the
                        causal relationship between these events. We exploit firm-level customs data from 2005 on-
                        wards to quantify firms’ exposure to EU and non-EU trade in inputs and outputs. Focusing
                        on investment as a forward-looking, dynamic outcome (since the UK did not leave the EU
                        until 2021), we relate firms’ investment to their pre-referendum EU exposure. This analysis
                        shows firms’ exposure to EU trade had a negative impact on investments post-referendum,
                        especially in 2021. Estimated impacts are stronger for import exposure than for export
                        exposure and there is some evidence of depressed investment from exposure to non-EU im-
                        ports, likely due to the large depreciation in sterling that followed the vote. Had the UK
                        voted to remain in the EU, these estimates imply manufacturing investment would have
                        been over 7% higher, about £2.4 billion annually between 2016 and 2021</div>
