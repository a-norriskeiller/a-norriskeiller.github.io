                    Consequences of Post-Brexit Trade Barriers for Earnings Inequality in the UK (Economica, 2021)</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden">We examine the distributional consequences of post-Brexit trade barriers 
                    on wages in the UK. We quantify changes in trade costs across industries, accounting for input–output 
                    links across domestic industries and global value chains. We allow for demand substitution by firms 
                    and consumers, and worker reallocation across industries. We document the impact at the individual 
                    and household level. Blue-collar workers are the most exposed to negative consequences of higher 
                    trade costs, because they are more likely to be employed in industries that face increases in trade 
                    costs, and are less likely to have good alternative employment opportunities available in their local 
                    labour markets. Overall, new trade costs have a regressive impact, with lower-paid workers facing 
                    higher exposure than higher-paid workers once we account for the exposure of other household members.</div>

                    inequality and the labour market in Britain and the US (JPubE, 2018)</a>
                <div class="abstract hidden">We study household income inequality in both Great Britain 
                    and the United States and the interplay between labour market earnings and the tax system. 
                    While both Britain and the US have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality 
                    over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in 
                    Britain while it has risen in the US. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the 
                    interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and 
                    welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed 
                    sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the US and 
                    on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain 
                    played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the 
                    relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the US mean this growing group has seen 
                    particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.</div>

            <p class="quote-text">Why, you haven’t even started yet. Go on. Quickly, hurry, 
                keep thinking. Having an idea, or identifying it, is something, but then again, once 
                absorbed, it’s almost nothing: it’s like arriving at the first, most elementary level, 
                which, it’s true, is more than most people ever do. But the really interesting and 
                difficult thing, the thing that can prove both truly worthwhile and very hard work is 
                to continue: to continue thinking and to continue looking beyond what is purely necessary, 
                when you have the feeling that there is no more to think and no more to see, that the 
                sequence is complete and that to continue would be a waste of time. In that wasted time 
                lies the truly important, in the gratuitous and apparently superfluous, beyond the limit 
                where you feel satisfied, or where you get tired or give up, often without realising it. 
                At the point where you might say to yourself there can’t be anything else. So tell me, 
                what else, what else occurs to you, what else can you bring to the argument, what else 
                can you offer, what else have you got? Go on thinking, quickly now, don’t stop, go on.<br><br> - Author Name</p>
